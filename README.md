# ft_fillit
Fillit is a project that let you discover and/or familiarize yourself with a recurring problematic in programming: searching the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities, in a respectable timing. In this particular project, you will have to find a way to assemble a given Tetriminos set altogether in the smallest possible square. A Tetriminos is a 4-blocks geometric figure you probably already heard of, thanks to the popular game Tetris.

Here are some links to some fellow 42 students who describe how to tackel fillit in detail:
